# Block Themes: My Learning Path
When I first delved into block themes, I found the abundance of guides overwhelming rather than helpful. In this repository, I’ve compiled the links, resources, and personal notes that finally made things click for me. While it’s not a definitive guide, I hope it provides some clarity for others starting their WP block theme journey.

What’s Inside
*	🔗 Key documentation and resources
*	💡 Personal notes and insights
*	⚠️ Troubleshooting tips
*	📝 Setup guides and explanations



> [!CAUTION] 
> Disclaimer : This repository reflects my personal understanding of WordPress block themes and is intended as a learning resource. Please note that while I’ve done my best to ensure accuracy, some information may not fully align with official practices or guidelines. I encourage you to cross-reference with primary sources and community insights as you explore. This is a work in progress, and feedback is always welcome!
